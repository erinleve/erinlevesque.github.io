								<h4>Course Description</h4>
								<p>
									In this class, teams of students design, build, test, launch, and operate an industry 
									standard prototype of a CubeSat. We learn to develop link budgets, power budgets, cost 
									budgets, and operate ground communications stations, and analyze test and flight data. 
									We also learn the basics of characterizing satellite performance and survivability in 
									the space environment (vacuum, vibration, functional). We gain experience with CAD and 
									rapid prototyping (3D printing), as well as non-technical skills such as program management 
									and team work.

								<h3>Winter 2022</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								In my first semester of the course in Winter of 2022, I worked as the Structures Team Co-Lead. 
								In this role, I helped delegate tasks to the sub-team members and maintained regular communication 
								to ensure the work was completed in a timely manner. Additionally, I developed testing procedures 
								and ran a series of tests to see if the structure would stay in tact during unexpected impact, and 
								subsequently designed, 3D-printed, and assembled spring-based shock absorbers to attach to the bottom 
								of the foam thermal protective layer. The CAD for these components can be seen below. Additionally, I 
								lead research on vibration and other oscillatory loads that the system might undergo during flight and 
								what components might be most vulnerable to this. However, due to the short time period that the 
								project was completed in, running an actual vibration test was not pursued.

								<h3>Fall 2023</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								During this semester I served as one of the course's Project Managers. In this role, I managed timelines, 
								regularly checked in with sub-team leads, and scheduled and help routine design updates throughout the 
								semester (Preliminary Design Review, Critical Design Review, and Flight Readiness Review). Additionally, 
								I compiled the course flight report by gathering images and documentation from each subteam. 
							</p>
							<p>
									In addition to my role as Project Manager, I also worked on the Communications sub-team. My tasks were 
									to configure and test the APRS Byonics tracking devices, set up and write unit tests for the U-Blox 
									NEO-M9N GPS module, and to assist in writing beacon definitions for transmitting data to ground stations 
									from the vehicle. 

									On day of flight, the GPS did not successfully obtain lock. Additionally, only one of the two Byonics 
									devices on in the flight train successfully tracked the flight path. This was due to non-lithium batteries, 
									which are not rated for low temperatures, being put into one of the devices. So, tracking was only successfully 
									done with APRS data from a single Byonics. The full communications final report can be found in the link below.

								<h3>Winter 2023</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								This semester, I am currently working as the “MC-10” development co-lead. MC-10 refers to the next in-space mission that 
								the MXL lab will develop. To lay the groundwork for the upcoming mission, my co-lead and have been delegating 
								cost estimates and trade studies, researching NASA proposal writing, communicating to different on-campus laboratories 
								to find interested researchers to develop a payload, and formalizing CFL testing and documentation procedures to develop 
								a streamline from the current stratospheric vehicles to future in-space cubesats.
