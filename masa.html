											University of Michigan's Rocketry Project Team

									<p>
										The Michigan Aeronautical Science Association (MASA) is a project team committed 
										to increasing student interest in high power rocketry at the University of Michigan. 
										Our goal is to teach students about the basics of rocketry and to provide hands-on 
										exposure to the design, build, and test phases of engineering. Starting in 2018, MASA 
										worked on the <a href="https://masa.engin.umich.edu/TSM/" target="_blank">Tangerine Space Machine</a> (TSM) project with the goal of launching the 
										first-ever student-built liquid-bipropellant rocket to the edge of space as we competed 
										for a $1M prize. Much of the system was designed, built and tested. While the project 
										was ultimately put on hold due to the cancellation of the contest we were competing in, 
										the projects I worked on include the recovery system and external aerodyanmics CFD. After 
										the TSM project was paused, MASA began working on <a href="https://masa.engin.umich.edu/Clem/" target="_blank">Clementine</a>, a single-stage pressure-fed,
										supersonic sounding rocket comprised of seam-welded stainless steel propellant tanks, 
										advanced avionics, and composite aerostructures. Clementine is designed to be over 20' tall 
										and is 10.5" in diameter, making it the largest student-built rocket in the United States. We 
										pride ourselves on having rockets and ground support systems designed, built, and tested in an 
										almost entirely student-led effort.  
									</p>

									<p>
										My work on the team has been primarily with the Aerodynamics & Recovery Subteam. I have 
										been a member of this subteam since Fall 2018, and I served as the Technical Lead during 
										my Sophomore Year. MASA Aerodynamics & Recovery is responsible for the design of rocket 
										aerodynamic surfaces such as the fins and nosecone and for the design of the rocket recovery 
										(parachute) system. In addition to being subteam technical lead, I also was the Recovery System 
										lead and co-lead all external aerodynamics CFD simulations for the team. Details of my work in these projects are found below.
									</p>

									<p>
										In addition to my work on Aerodynamics & Recovery, I have worked with production to manufacture 
										various components for the team on the manual mill, and I worked with the ATLO (Assembly, Test & 
										Launch Operations ) team, leading component vibration testing. This work entailed understanding 
										the virbration profile of the rocket, designing test mounts for components vulnerable to these 
										dynamic loads, and running tests on the vibration table under the guidance of Dr. Jon Van Noord, 
										Chief Mechanical Engineer in Research at the Space Physics Research Laboratory (SPRL).

							<p> Because it was not feasible for a student team to test in a supersonic wind tunnel large enough for our components, 
								I worked to instead simulate TSM's flight regime to approximate temperatures caused by aerodynamic heating. The heating 
								experienced by the nosecone was the primary concern. A simple CAD model of the nosecone was made in Solidworks. Next, 
								I worked with another teammember to simulate the heat transfer on the nosecone. We began with the temperature at the 
								wall throughout the flight profile. Then, using STAR-CCM+ and known atmospheric data, we ran a series of simulations 
								at critical time steps and wall conditions, and then we interpolated to get values for air temperature at along the nosecone 
								wall as a function of time. 
								This data set was then plugged into a transient thermal simulation in ANSYS fluent and we solved for convection heat 
								onto the nosecone as a function of time. From here, we were able to obtain a realistic temperature estimates that the nosecone 
								will experience during flight.
