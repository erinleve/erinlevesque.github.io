								<h3>Mission</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								The mission of Black Students in Aerospace (BSA) at the University of Michigan is to provide Black 
								students pursuing aerospace engineering with the resources they need to be successful in the field. 
								We aim to build and maintain a strong academic, professional, and social community of all those interested 
								in space and aviation related works at the University, regardless of declared major, age, and background.
								Additionally, we are committed to increasing visibility of Black figures within the industry by highlighting 
								Black successes of those who came before us as well as providing representation to younger students in our community. 
							</p>

								<h3>What We Do</h3>
							</header>
							<h4>Professional Development</h4>
							<p>
								Our organization holds a wide range of events that focus on building our members' networking and interview 
								skills as well as the required skills to be sucessful once the are working in industry. These events include mock 
								interviews, resume reviews, elevator pitch worksshops and more. We also host regular collaborative events with 
								represenatives from top aerospace companies each semester in the form of panels, individual guest speakers, 
								recruiting events, company tours, and more as an opportunity for them to share with us their experiences, advice, and sometimes 
								one-on-one mentorship as our members navigate internship and full-time work searches. 
							</p>
							<p>
								In addition to these professional events, BSA annually sponsors our members to attend professional and research 
								conferences by convering all registration, travel, lodging and food expenses. This allows the members of our student 
								organization to have key networking and skill-building opportunities without financial burden.

											<h4>Education-Focused Events</h4>
										</header>
										<p>
											BSA also holds events and workshops that focus on building strategic study habits, the experiences of pursing 
											an undergraduate and graduate aerospace engineering education, and how engineering curriculum and resources at the
											University of Michigan can be improved or restructured. Many of these events are in collaboration with other student
											organizations or University-affiliated institutions, such as the Science Learning Center and the College of Engineering 
											Office of Student Affairs. We also hold occasional wellness study sessions in which we create a low stress space where 
											students can gather, do homework, learn about managing stress levels with mental wellness techniques, and enjoy free food 
											and tea in the presence of peers.

							<h4>Outreach</h4>
							<p>
								A core value that BSA members share is
the importance of creating an equitable
community in which all have access to
necessary resources. Particularly, BSA
focuses on STEM education accessibility
and has been developing workshops to
introduce aerospace enginering to K-12
students from underrepresented
backgrounds in the metro-Detroit area.
